# Accessing to the Lab Environment

## Getting your dedicated lab environments using Guid Grabber

On your laptop, you **MUST** open a browser tab with [*Lab GUID Assignment page*](https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_tester) before continuing with the lab instructions:

* From this page, you will be assigned your unique GUID, which you will use to access your unique lab environment and systems.


> **NOTE: You are not required to login anywhere at this point, in this intro lab you will only get the information related to your assigned lab environments.**

### Getting Cluster Environment - **Browser Tab**

This will be your lab environment where all of the work will be done. 

From the drop down list:

1. Choose the lab `A1006 - Developer Console on OpenShift with Serverless`
2. Enter the activation key shared by the instructors
3. Enter your email address
4. Click submit
5. Save the information on screen

e.g:

![Request Env GuidGrabber](assets/request-env-gg.png)

The resulting *Lab Information page* will display your lab's GUID and other useful information about your lab environment.
Take note of your assigned GUID.

You will use this GUID to access your lab's environment and systems.
Your unique GUID will also be embedded in your lab environment's host names.


### Login to Openshift Console

On the *Lab Information page* you will get the URL *Openshift Master Console*. This is the web console that we want to login and use for most of the lab instuctions. The username and password to access the console will be there below the URLs as well.

1. Click on the URL and open the link in another tab.
2. Use the credentials to login to the console on login screen.
