## Overview and Intro to Developer Perspective

OpenShift Developer Console adds a new developer perspective to the default web console that comes with OCP 4.2+. The original web console that came deployed on openshift cluster was very admin centric and often seemed very confusing for a simple developer workflow like importing a git repository and building the application that gets deployed on openshift. So, the new developer perspective adds curated developer workflows that makes it easy for a developer to use the console and create/test their applications in openshift seamlessly. Developer perspective also integrates serverless capabilties using Knative Serving Operator into these workflows. It also allows a developer to easily create and visualise their pipelines using Openshift Pipelines that uses Tekton.
