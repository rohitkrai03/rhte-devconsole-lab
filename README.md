# Red Hat Tech Exchange Lab - Hands on with Developer Console on OpenShift

This page contains a series of instructions for hands-on lab on OpenShift Developer Console conducted during Red Hat Tech exchange.


## Session Abstract
Openshift 4 has made Kubernetes even better. The new Developer Console provides a fresh perspective that supports the developer mindset and adds curated workflows for developers while still working with the Admin console for the Operators. Adding Knative Serving which directly integrates into the developer workflows simplifies the experience further. The latest version of OpenShift now supports Knative and this hands-on lab will walk you through everything you need to know. We will start with going through some of the most common developer workflows and how developer console import flows improves that experience, after that we'll move on to activating Knative support in OpenShift which will extend the import flows letting us create Serverless applications seamlessly. We will go through the new Topology view that helps a developer visualise, understand and interact with all the applications in his namespace at a glance. We will also go through basics of Tekton Pipelines and how developer console can help visualise and build your pipelines. Come see what the new OpenShift Developer console has to offer.


### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Openshift is required for this lab. Also, some knowledge of Knative and Tekton Pipelines would be beneficial but not required.
